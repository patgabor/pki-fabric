## Overview

pki-fabric is an educational project developed to facilitate a deeper understanding of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) concepts and cryptographic data handling within the .NET ecosystem. It offers foundational utilities and types for working with:

- PEM-encoded cryptographic artifacts, including certificates, private keys, and certificate signing requests (CSRs)
- Parsing and representation of common Subject Alternative Name (SAN) types such as DNS names, IP addresses, RFC 822 email addresses, URIs, and other SAN variants
- Core components of X.509 certificates and associated cryptographic materials

## Features

- Fundamental parsing and serialization of PEM-formatted cryptographic content
- Support for a variety of SAN types to aid exploration of certificate extensions
- Implementation following immutable and idiomatic .NET design principles to reinforce best coding practices
- Primarily intended as a learning tool for experimentation and prototyping rather than production use

## Intended Audience and Usage

This project is designed to support developers, researchers, and learners aiming to:

- Gain practical insight into certificate structures and cryptographic data representation
- Understand the handling and processing of Subject Alternative Names within the context of X.509 certificates
- Build foundational knowledge of PKI operations using .NET technologies

This project should be regarded as a resource for educational purposes and skill development rather than a comprehensive production framework.
